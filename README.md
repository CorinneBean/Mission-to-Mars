# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to practice HTML Web scraping on Mars data using the Flask web application, Python and MongoDB. In this project I created a Python script which then proceeded to scrape text and images from websites that constained information on Mars. The data which was scrapped was then stored in a Mongo database and a HTML template was used to design a website using Bootsrap to display all the data in a central location.
